## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my learning and hands-on practice with **PowerShell pipeline fundamentals**.  
The primary focus of this script is understanding **how PowerShell works with objects through the pipeline**, rather than plain text processing.

The script uses **real system data** such as services, files, and CSV data to demonstrate:
- Filtering
- Selecting
- Grouping
- Measuring
- Comparing
- Exporting data

## 🎯 What I Learned from This Script

By writing and executing this script, I learned:

- How the **PowerShell pipeline (`|`) passes objects**, not text
- Why storing command output in **variables improves performance**
- How to **filter, select, group, and measure objects**
- The difference between **pipeline-based** and **parameter-based** commands
- How to work with **CSV files as objects**
- How to create **calculated properties**
- Why **formatting cmdlets** should be used **only for display**

## 1️⃣ Working with Services

### Concepts Learned
- Cmdlets return **objects**
- Storing output in variables avoids **repeated execution**
- Objects contain properties like `Status` and `Name`

### Key Commands
```powershell
$a = Get-Service
$a | Select-Object -Last 10 -Property Status, Name
$a.Count
$a | Export-Csv .\test.csv -NoTypeInformation
